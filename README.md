Dataset and R code associated with the Bastianoni et al 2022 paper on the contribution of Shallow-Water Hydrothermal vents degassing to the global Carbon Budget

The reposeitory contains the following files:

- README.md (this readme file)
- Bastianoni et al_2022_SWHTV.r (the r code to reproduce the figures)
- shtv3.csv (the main dataset used for obtaining the estimates)


Published data are from Arc Volcanoes data obtained from Sano and Williams (1996); Active Subaerial Volcanoes from Burton et al. (2013) and Fischer et al. (2019); East African Rift from (Lee et al., 2016); Mt. Etna from Aiuppa et al. (2017); Mid ocean ridges  from Varekamp et al. (1992), Marty and  (1998), Hauri et al. (2019) and Bekaert et al. (2021); Volcanic Lakes from Perez et al. (2011); Hydrothermal systems data from Werner et al. (2019).
